### Authorization/Authentication
In order to authorize in the app, the user has only an option to use Google OAuth 2.0. 
![OAuth diagram](oauthdiag.png?raw=true "OAuth 2.0 Diagram")
On the diagram above depicted the way the user is authorized in the app. As backend verifies google token, the **JWT token** is created using app's secret and user's id. After that, this JWT token is saved on the user side as a cookie. Everytime the frontend does an authorized request to the backend, it adds this token in the header of the request, this token is then verified on the backend side and information from it is decoded.

### Background tasks
For background tasks the **celery** was used, which is run in a different process. In order for Django to communicate with celery **redis** was used as a broker. The following processes were taken into the background:

- Identifying and cleaning expired links from the database. *Regularity*: every 2 minutes.
- Removal of previously deleted files by users. *Regularity*: every 24 hours.
- Updating user statistics. *Toggle*: every time file/folder is deleted/uploaded.
- Updating folders metadata. *Toggle*: every time file/folder is deleted/uploaded.

Background tasks transfered resource heavy tasks in a different queue and thus freed up a lot of time for the user, who doesn't need to wait for this tasks to end before receiving response and keep working with the application.

### Exceptions handling
In order to log exceptions on the production side **sentry** service is used - every error is fixated by sentry-sdk and can be found on the sentry project page.
